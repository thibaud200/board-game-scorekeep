# Board Game Score Tracker - Modular Architecture PRD

## Core Purpose & Success
- **Mission Statement**: A modular, responsive board game tracking system that adapts seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices while maintaining easy extensibility for new features.
- **Success Indicators**: Smooth interaction across all device types, intuitive navigation without tabs, modular codebase allowing feature addition without major restructuring.
- **Experience Qualities**: Adaptive, Modular, Intuitive

## Project Classification & Approach
- **Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state management)
- **Primary User Activity**: Interacting (managing game sessions and player data)

## Thought Process for Feature Selection
- **Core Problem Analysis**: Current tab-based navigation doesn't work well on mobile; feature additions require significant refactoring
- **User Context**: Users need quick access to key functions regardless of device; mobile users need touch-friendly interfaces
- **Critical Path**: Dashboard → Quick Actions → Game Management → Results Tracking
- **Key Moments**: Starting a new game, managing players inline, viewing contextual history/stats

## Essential Features

### Modular Dashboard System
- **What it does**: Central hub with interactive cards for each major function
- **Why it matters**: Eliminates tab navigation, provides device-appropriate interfaces
- **Success criteria**: All core functions accessible within 2 taps/clicks from dashboard

### Contextual Navigation
- **What it does**: History and stats integrated within relevant sections rather than separate tabs
- **Why it matters**: Reduces cognitive load, provides context-aware information
- **Success criteria**: Users can view player stats from player management, game history from game sections

### Responsive Component Architecture
- **What it does**: Components automatically adapt layout based on screen size
- **Why it matters**: Consistent experience across all devices
- **Success criteria**: Smooth interaction on screens from 320px to 1920px+

### Enhanced Character Assignment
- **What it does**: Allows players to have both custom character names and select from predefined character types (e.g., "Mike (Psychic)")
- **Why it matters**: Provides flexibility for role-playing games while maintaining template structure
- **Success criteria**: Clear input for character name and type selection, proper display in game and history

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Efficient, modern, approachable
- **Design Personality**: Clean and functional with subtle gaming touches
- **Visual Metaphors**: Card-based interface resembling game components
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimal but with clear visual hierarchy

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Monochromatic with accent highlights
- **Primary Color**: Deep blue for trust and stability (oklch(0.45 0.15 240))
- **Secondary Colors**: Warm gold for achievements (oklch(0.65 0.15 45))
- **Accent Color**: Bright orange for actions (oklch(0.70 0.20 50))
- **Color Psychology**: Blue builds trust for data tracking, gold celebrates achievements, orange drives action
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - background (white) + foreground (dark blue): 15.8:1 contrast ✓
  - primary (deep blue) + primary-foreground (white): 8.2:1 contrast ✓
  - secondary (gold) + secondary-foreground (dark blue): 5.1:1 contrast ✓

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family (Inter) with varied weights
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headers (600-700), body (400), and secondary text (400 muted)
- **Font Personality**: Modern, clean, highly legible
- **Which fonts**: Inter from Google Fonts
- **Legibility Check**: Inter is optimized for screen reading ✓

### Layout Architecture
- **Mobile-First Design**: Start with mobile constraints, progressively enhance
- **Grid System**: CSS Grid for major layout, Flexbox for component internals
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px for all interactive elements
- **Responsive Breakpoints**: sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px), xl (1280px)

### Component Modularity
- **Feature Modules**: Self-contained components with clear interfaces
- **Shared Components**: Reusable UI elements with consistent props
- **Context Boundaries**: Clear separation between feature domains
- **Extension Points**: Hook-based architecture for easy feature addition

## Implementation Considerations
- **Component Structure**: Feature-based folder organization
- **State Management**: useKV for persistence, useState for local state
- **Device Detection**: CSS-based responsive design with JavaScript enhancement
- **Performance**: Lazy loading for non-critical features

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
- **Small screens**: Collapsible sections, swipe navigation
- **Large screens**: Multi-column layouts, contextual sidebars
- **Touch vs. Mouse**: Hover states only on non-touch devices
- **Offline usage**: All data persisted locally via useKV

## Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance (4.5:1 minimum)
- **Touch Accessibility**: 44px minimum touch targets
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility
- **Screen Reader**: Semantic HTML with proper ARIA labels
